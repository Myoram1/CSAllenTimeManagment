    <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>A technical challenge that we faced was trying to push everything to our git repository. Some of the team members didn't have it set up, while some didn't know how to do it at all. Since none of us knew how to push to git, we had to search the codermerlin wiki for a little bit, which wasted a bit of time but it wasn't too much of a problem. Now we know how to push our work to the git repostitory and won't have to deal with this problem later on.</p>
    <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p>This week we did have a few scheduling challnges. Some team members were busy with other classwork, sports, and other things. Unforutnately, this took a lot of time away from working on our ISP, so we lost a bit of work and some ideas. To combat this in the future, we've decided to set up times to work on the ISP when everyone can, instead of randomly deciding to work. This way everyone can be heard and avaliable and make the whole process smoother for everybody involved.</p>
    <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p>This week we decided to start on what our logo or app icon would look like. Each team member had different ideas, so we listened to each one and had a discussion on which idea would be best and why. Through this discussion, we were able to come up with a logo that we were all happy with, and ended up with a better ISP becuase of it. In the future, we plan on continuing to have civil discussion as it works really well for our group.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>A technical challenge that we faced was not knowing how to implement a lot of our ideas into the actual project. This was because nobody in our group knew how to write the code for the ideas we had. One idea we had was to have a clock that would tick and show the current time, but there are multiple different obstacles when it comes to doing this correctly. We intend to overcome this challenge by studying outside of class and going to tutoring so that we can learn how to make our ISP the way we intend it to be made.</p>
      <br><h2 style='text-align:center'>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      This week we didn't encounter any challenges with scheduling. We have a groupchat that we use to discuss ideas outside of class, and facetime so that we can work together when we have free time. Whenever somebody is busy or not able to work, it isn't that big of a deal since we have a lot of time in and out of class already to work and are constantly trying to improve our original idea.</p>
      <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>Some interpersonal challenges we encountered were deciding on colors and layouts for our UI. One team member wanted to have lots of color while another wanted to try and keep it as minimalistic as possible. We decided to reference popular UI's that do well and decided on what would work best for our ISP. At the end, we were all happy with the result.</p>

    <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>A technical challenge that we will face will be not knowing enough about the code. This will make the project more difficult since we don't practice writing in Swift. Although it will slow down the development, we will learn Swift along the way and learn a new skill. We will overcome this challenge by practicing Swift outside of class.</p>
      <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>Another difficulty we will face will be scheduling challenges. Although we meet every other day for class, I suspect that it won't be enough time to finish the project in time. Down the road, we will have to meet outside of class in order to finish in time. To overcome this challenge, we've made a groupchat where we can plan out times to meet, and to find what works best for each other.</p>
      <br><h2 style="text-align:center">Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
      <p>As people, we will always have creative differences. One team member might like to have a certain background color while another might hate it. To overcome this challenge, we plan to reference popular user interfaces and find one that we all like to use as inspiration for ours. Another way to overcome this challenge is to have civil discussions on what is best for the project and why.</p>
