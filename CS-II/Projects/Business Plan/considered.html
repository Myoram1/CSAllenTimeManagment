    <br><p>This is a great idea but has some downfalls. A lot of students that wait till the last second to do their homework don't want to be bothered by a program and instead should focus on their work. Also, they market to truckers, but most truckers know to not drive when tired.</p>

    <br><p>Although this is a good idea, there are a lot of programs already like this. Also, if you have any suspicions that your personal computer screen is being monitored, then a malware scan is usually more then enough.</p>

    <br><p>This is not a bad idea, but it has been so overdone already that another one would be another drop in the ocean. Google Maps and Apple Maps already offer this service, so why would somebody download another app for it? Also, most people already have a set of resturants they enjoy and aren't intersted in trying new ones.</p>

    <br><p>This is a good idea, but its already a thing. Swivel mounts have been a thing for some time now. Most of the time. Also, most people think before they mount their TV, and would not benefit from a swiveling mount</p>

    <br><p>This does not seem like a bad game, but when you look at the other ISPs on the spreadsheet, most of them are benefiting humanity, or helping to solve a boring task. This game does neither, and although it seems fun, does not offer the same benefits as the other ISPs.</p>
    <br><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Considered 6</a>
    <br><p>This website provides a questionare to provide a session related to helping someone who needs therapy. I considered this website because it seems like a useful idea, but I would prefer the ones already made as they might be more efficient and helpful depending on their research. It sounds like a great idea, but unfortunately there wouldnt be many uses for this website if the quizzes that already existed were in use.</p>
    <br><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophia-tran/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Considered 7</a>
    <br><p>This app allows people to book a table for a restaurant digitally, meaning you wont have to wait at the restaurant or wait at another place for your table. This also is intended to help restaurants with their reservation line; it makes the process easier. Although, this app may have many benefits, there are also many problems with the digital process. Going to the restaurant in person to make a reservation can help people socialize and make less mistakes for orders.</p>
    <br><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/joshua-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Considred 8</a>
    <br><p>This app helps classes take attendance by using a facial recognition program, which improves classroom efficiency and database organization. I could possibly see this occuring sometime in the future, but I dont think this is neccessary at the moment. I realize most classes dont even spend their whole class period and end up having extra time at the end or for brain breaks. Classes in college however, have a id scanner that is similar to the face recognition except you just have to put your id next to it and it will scan in, checking you attendance. Although this idea could possibly save some time, I dont feel like its neccesary yet and we should prioritize other topics instead.</p>

    <br><p>The Restaurant Picker is an app that will generate a list of different restaurants depending on the users preferences. This could be useful to those who are having trouble on deciding what to eat for lunch or dinner. Although The Restaurant Picker has certain benefits, I feel like most poeple would rather choose places theyre comfortable with and already know what they want to eat before hand. Although this app could be useful sometimes, it may not be used as much considering most people are already aware of the food choices available to them in their local area. Also, it might possibly be better if the app didnt choose via a wheel and let the user choose themselves.</p>
    <br><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/danelle-corbita/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Accepted ISP</a>
    <br><p>I accepted this app because I struggle with time management myself and I understand the downsides of procrastinating. So I have a lot of experience with the weaknesses of productivity, which may be useful for providing examples of why being productive is important. I believe this app will benefit many people as I know majority of people procrastinate and are not productive a lot of times.</p>
