    <br><p>The two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection is to secure communication and data transfer between a user's web browser and a website. HTTPS is a request/response protocol between clients and servers used for secure communications and transfers. A common attack that HTTPS can help to prevent is a MITM attack, also known as a man in the middle attack. A MITM is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. With this attack sensitive data is at risk of being stolen. One of the ways our data is protected is through hashes. A hash is a mathematical functiion that converts an input of arbitrary length into an encrypted output of a fixed length. There are three good values of a good hash function. The hash value is fully determined by the data being hashed, the hash function uses all the input data, and the hash function "uniformly" distributes the data across the entire set of possible hash values. A way HTTPS keeps us safe is through a CA, or a certificate authority. A CA is a trusted entity that issues digital certifiates to authenticate content sent from web servers. It is used to make the internet more secure for organizations and users alike. In order to prevent SSL interceptions, you should educate yourself on how they work and happen, in order to prevent it. In order to detect it, the easiest way is to check to see if the authentic certificate of the site you are visiting matches the one it is giving you. A false positive is when something comes up as positive but is actually negative, and a false negative is the opposite. I believe that my school, governmetn, and ISP do not have a right to eavesdrop on my communication, or anyboody else's. It is private, and should stay private.</p>
