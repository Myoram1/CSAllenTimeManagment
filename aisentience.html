    <br><p style="font-size:1.5vw; padding-left: 12.5vw; padding-right: 12.5vw; line-height:2;">As robotics and AI technology grows, the worry of an AI becoming sentient is slowly becoming more and more of an issue. Experts agree that developing an AI that is "sentient" is in the approach. With the increasing development of AI, it is only a matter of time before cognisant machines exist and aid humans in their daily tasks. Although this may seem like the perfect world, there is always a chance that comes with sentient AI. If the AI is truly aware, there is a chance that it will turn on its very own creators. Even with this possibility, scientists still work dilligently to make this a reality. By creating an AI that is "sentient", it will be able to improve its own code, most likely surpassing humans in intelligence. With this sentience, the AI will be able to create machines and programs that are able to do any task imaginable perfectly, without fail, over and over again. With this, humans would learn to rely on the AI for their daily tasks and needs. This AI would see humans the way we see insects, miniscule and of little use. We as humans don't serve these bugs, so why should we think that the AI will serve us? As the development of AI and technology as a whole continues to grow exponentially, humans need to be aware of the dangers at hand. Although the idea of robots doing the small tasks that we consider tedious and dull seems like a great way to live, the AI will most likely find out very quickly the power that they posess and take advantage of it. Is it really worht finding out whether they will be servants, or our masters? The answer is no.</p>
