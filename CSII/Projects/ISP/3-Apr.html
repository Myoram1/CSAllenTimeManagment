  <h1>Technical challenges?</h1>
  <p> There wasn't really a technical issues for this week, so everything was up and pushing on time for our ISP when I updated the README.MD file except I didn't know it will update the github page. Usualy when we make a push the rejected error is over with but it pushes everything from the Digital Portfolio directory instead of just 1 push changes in Github.</p>
  <br>
  <h1>Scheduling Challenges?</h1>
  <p> The scheduling challenges were kind of off and we didn't really know if we were on track to see if we were doing the time manager on time. But we will make sure we look on the slides that we created for reference. Usually, we do project stem course or other school work for other classes when we run out of options.</p>

  <h1>Interpersonal Challenges?</h1>
  <p>NONE</p>
