	We will provide some study methods in which you can use your study time efficiently so you dont have to result in procrastination. Of course, everyone has different ways of studying, but these methods can help those who have a hard time focusing while they are studying. 
	  <h1>Blurting Method</h1><br>
	  The blurting method is a very powerful method used to review and understand what you have learned. However, in order to use this method, you will need notes for what you want to review. The more notes means the more amount of work you will review. First you are going to want to look over your notes and try to understand your notes. After you have reviewed your notes, you want to put your notes to the side and grab a clean sheet of paper. On this sheet of paper, you are going to write down everything you can remember from your notes. Don't spend too much time on this step but give yourself enough time to where you will have a good percentage of what you remember. Next, your going to compare your notes to the sheet of paper where you have written what you memorized, and in another color, you will fill in the rest of what you did not remember. If you wrote something wrong, make sure to correct it in another color as well.  Repeating these steps every single day can help you review your notes and let you memorize them before a upcoming test or quiz.<br><br>
	  <h1>Feynman Technique</h1><br>
	  The Feynman Technique is a very powerful study method which focuses more on understanding the material rather than memorizing it. There are many reasons and benefits to understanding material, while on the other hand, memorizing the material may only be useful for a temporary time, or not useful at all. For this study method, there are only four steps that you will need to do in order to better understand the material you are learning or have already learned. First, grab a piece of paper and write down the concept or topic's name that you want to understand as much as possible. Next, you want to write and explain what the concept is and try to explain the concept in a way where someone else can understand it easily because the explanation is simple. After explaining the concept in a simple way, try and locate problem areas or areas you had trouble explaining and review those areas. Last but not least, try to simplify your explanation even more, try and spot complicated words or language in your explanation and see if you can simplify your word choice. After completing these steps, you will better understand the concept/topic you have chosen which may help you solve other problems regarding this concept.<br><br>
