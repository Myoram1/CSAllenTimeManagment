	<h1>Technical challenges?</h1>
	<p>Some of the technical challenges I faced are, when our group tried to create the github repository, we were facing issues along the way as well as Github  asking us for username and password whenever we create a git push, and errors doing git pull. We also were kind of facing challenges when we were creating the TimeManagmentPresentation, we were not sure who is doing which role in creating the app.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Scheduling Challenges?</h1>
	<p>When we created the scheduling timeline in the TimeManagmentPresentation, we were kind of unsure of when and what date we needed to do. The fact that we didn't create the Projects in the Github, we still haven't done that yet.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Interpersonal Challenges?</h1>
	The major interpersonal challenge was that one of my group members and I were working on the TimeManagmentPresentation, and the remandier of the people were just on their phones and not communicating. We tried convincing the group members, my group member, and I and it worked better.
