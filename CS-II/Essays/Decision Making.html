      <br><p>Decision-making in a group setting can be complex and challenging. Several factors can affect decision-making, including group dynamics, individual personalities, group size, time constraints, and task complexity.</p>

<p>	How individuals interact and relate to each other within a group can significantly affect decision-making. For example, a group with high levels of trust and cooperation is likelier to make effective decisions than a group with low levels of trust and collaboration (Johnson & Johnson, 2008). Additionally, the leadership style of the group leader can also impact the decision-making process (Fisher & Ury, 1991). I plan to overcome this in my group by being in a group with people whom I trust and whom I know well instead of being in a group with new people whom I have yet to get to know.</p>

<p>	The personalities of the individuals within a group can also impact decision-making. For example, a group with several dominant personalities may have difficulty reaching a consensus, while a group with more introverted members may have difficulty expressing their opinions (Nemeth, 1986). I plan to overcome this in my group by allowing everybody to voice their opinions. Although it may seem wise to let everybody stick to their strengths, it would be beneficial if everybody got a say in what our project came out to be. By doing this, we may sacrifice a small amount of time, but by planning, we will be able to listen to each member.</p>

<p>	The size of the group can also impact decision-making. Research has shown that small groups are generally more effective at making decisions than large groups (Mullen, Johnson, & Salas, 1991). Small groups allow for more individual participation and input, leading to more diverse perspectives and better decision-making. We have already overcome this by not having a large group. Our group is no more than four, so it is easy to bounce ideas off and listen to each other without too many people trying to get their opinion in at once.</p>

<p>	The amount of time available for decision-making can also affect the process. Groups under time pressure may be more likely to make decisions quickly without fully considering all options (Janis, 1972). This pressure can lead to poor decision-making and potential negative consequences. We have already overcome this as we have much time to complete our ISP and plan to plan accordingly.</p>

<p>	The task at hand can also impact decision-making. Complex tasks may require more time and effort to consider all potential options and make an informed decision fully. Additionally, complex tasks may require the input of multiple experts, which can add to the difficulty of the decision-making process (Fisher & Ury, 1991). We as a group overcame this obstacle by choosing an ISP that is not so challenging that it is overwhelming but enough so that it gives us a learning experience.</p>

      <p>	In conclusion, several different factors can affect decision-making in a group setting. These include group dynamics, individual personalities, group size, time constraints, and task complexity. Group members must be aware of these factors and work together to overcome challenges and make effective decisions.</p>
